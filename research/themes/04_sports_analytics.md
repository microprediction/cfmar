# Sports Analytics and Event Prediction

The Sports Network (subnet 41) processes sports events and provides predictions for various sports and leagues. 

The system handles sports events from multiple leagues, using a combination of prediction models, including deep learning architectures and statistical analysis tools.

The architecture processes sports data streams, incorporating data from game statistics, player performance metrics, and historical data archives.

The system handles predictions in time-sensitive scenarios, with response times under 100 milliseconds.

The system tracks and evaluates predictions, using the results to update model weights. It maintains metrics across different sports, event types, and time periods.

Score Vision (subnet 44) specializes in sports score prediction and analysis. The network focuses on predicting final scores and game outcomes across multiple sports. It processes historical score data and current game statistics to generate predictions. The system maintains separate models for different sports, each optimized for the specific characteristics of that sport's scoring patterns.
