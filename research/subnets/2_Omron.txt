Subnet 2, known as Omron, is a specialized decentralized network within the Bittensor ecosystem focused on integrating zero-knowledge machine learning (zk-ML) into AI inference tasks. The primary objective of Omron is to enhance the privacy, verifiability, and efficiency of AI model predictions by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

Miners in Omron are responsible for generating AI model predictions that are not only accurate but also verifiable through ZKPs. They utilize AI models that have been converted into zero-knowledge circuits, allowing them to produce predictions along with cryptographic proofs that validate the correctness of these predictions without revealing the underlying data. This approach ensures that the AI model's outputs can be trusted without exposing sensitive information, addressing concerns related to data privacy and model integrity.

Validators play a crucial role in the Omron subnet by evaluating the ZKPs provided by miners. They verify the authenticity of the cryptographic proofs accompanying the AI model predictions, ensuring that the predictions are both accurate and generated by the specified model. Validators score the miners based on the quality and efficiency of the proofs, considering factors such as proof size and generation time. These evaluations are essential for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the subnet's operations.

The incentive mechanism within Omron is designed to reward miners and validators based on their contributions to the network. Miners are compensated for generating high-quality, verifiable predictions, while validators are rewarded for accurately assessing the validity of these predictions. This system encourages continuous improvement and innovation in the development of zk-ML models and verification processes. By integrating ZKPs into AI inference, Omron aims to provide a scalable and secure framework for decentralized AI applications, ensuring that model outputs are both trustworthy and privacy-preserving
