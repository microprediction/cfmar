Functionality
In Tensorplex, miners develop and deploy AI agents capable of performing specific tasks. These agents are designed to communicate with one another, exchange data, and coordinate actions to achieve common goals. Validators assess the performance of these agents by evaluating their ability to collaborate effectively, adapt to dynamic environments, and contribute to the overall objectives of the subnet.​

Incentive Mechanism
Participants in Tensorplex are rewarded based on the quality and efficiency of their AI agents' interactions. The incentive structure encourages the development of agents that can seamlessly integrate into the network, cooperate with others, and enhance the collective intelligence of the system.​
