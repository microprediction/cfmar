Miners in the EdgeMaxxing subnet are tasked with submitting optimized versions of AI models that are tailored to run efficiently on specified consumer hardware platforms. They employ various algorithms and techniques to enhance model performance, ensuring that the models maintain high accuracy while reducing their computational demands. These optimized models are then submitted as checkpoints, which serve as snapshots of the model's state after training and optimization. Miners are incentivized to continually improve their models, as their submissions are evaluated based on performance metrics such as speed improvements, accuracy retention, and overall efficiency gains.​

Validators in the EdgeMaxxing subnet play a crucial role in assessing the quality and effectiveness of the models submitted by miners. They are responsible for running the submitted models on specified target hardware, such as high-end consumer GPUs, to benchmark their performance. Validators compare the performance of each model against baseline checkpoints to determine improvements in speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Based on these evaluations, validators score the models and select the top-performing ones as winners of the daily competitions. This process ensures that only the most optimized and effective models are recognized and rewarded, driving continuous improvement within the subnet.​
