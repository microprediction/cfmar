Subnet 27, known as Neural Internet, is a decentralized compute layer within the Bittensor network. It functions as a permissionless compute market, enabling miners to contribute GPU and CPU resources, which are then utilized by AI applications and models. This approach decentralizes computational power, moving away from centralized cloud providers and fostering a more open and distributed infrastructure for AI development.

Miners in Subnet 27 provide computational resources by setting up hardware, primarily GPUs, and registering them within the network. They specify the duration for which these resources are available, allowing for dynamic allocation based on demand. Validators assess the performance and reliability of these resources through a series of tests, including cryptographic challenges, to ensure that the computational power meets the network's standards.

The validation process involves miners solving cryptographic puzzles, similar to proof-of-work mechanisms, to demonstrate the authenticity and capability of their hardware. This method prevents fraudulent reporting of hardware specifications and ensures that only legitimate resources are utilized. Validators verify the solutions provided by miners, adjusting the difficulty of the challenges based on the miner's performance history and hardware specifications.

The network operates on a dual-token incentive system, utilizing both TAO and NI tokens. Miners are rewarded with these tokens based on the computational resources they provide and the accuracy of their hardware claims. This incentivizes participation and ensures that high-quality resources are consistently available to meet the demands of AI applications.

In summary, Subnet 27 establishes a decentralized, trustless compute market within the Bittensor ecosystem. By allowing miners to contribute computational resources and validating their capabilities through cryptographic challenges, it creates a robust infrastructure that supports the scalable and efficient execution of AI models.



Bittensor Subnet 27, known as Ni Compute, is a decentralized compute network designed to provide scalable and efficient computational resources for AI tasks. It integrates various cloud platforms, such as Runpod, Lambda, and AWS, into a cohesive unit, enabling seamless compute composability across different underlying platforms. This approach allows for efficient resource sharing and allocation, addressing the growing demand for high-performance computing in AI development.​

Miners in Subnet 27 contribute processing resources, notably GPU and CPU instances, to facilitate optimal performance in essential computing tasks. They have the autonomy to set specific timelines for each reservation of their computational resources, dictating the duration for which the resources are allocated to a particular task or user. Once the set timeline concludes, the reservation automatically expires, freeing up the resources for subsequent allocations. This dynamic reservation mechanism ensures efficient distribution of computational power, catering to varying demands within the network.​

Validators in Subnet 27 hold the critical responsibility of rigorously assessing and verifying the computational capabilities of miners. They request comprehensive performance data from miners, including metrics like processing speeds, RAM capacity, and disk space availability. Validators then present complex hashing challenges to miners to evaluate their processing power and reliability. The difficulty of these challenges is adjusted based on the miners' performance profiles. Validators meticulously verify the accuracy of the responses, considering both speed and precision, along with hardware utilization metrics. Based on this extensive analysis, validators update the miners' scores, reflecting their computational capacity, efficiency, and hardware quality. These scores determine the miners' weight within the network, influencing their potential rewards and standing.​
