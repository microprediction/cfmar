Bittensor Subnet 20, known as BitAgent, is a decentralized subnet focused on task and workflow management by integrating large language models (LLMs) with commonly used applications such as web browsers, Discord, and custom integrations. The primary goal of BitAgent is to simplify and automate daily tasks through intelligent agency, offering personalized assistance and integrated task automation across platforms.​

Miners in Subnet 20 are responsible for executing tasks defined by the subnet's incentive mechanism. These tasks include semantic question answering, summarization, recency-based question answering, logic-based question answering, and integrated orchestration. Miners compete based on their performance in completing these tasks, and their success is measured by validators who assess the quality and accuracy of their outputs. Miners are incentivized to maintain high performance to earn rewards, and their registration status is influenced by their task completion efficiency and effectiveness.​

Validators in Subnet 20 play a crucial role in evaluating the performance of miners. They assess the outputs generated by miners, scoring them based on accuracy, relevance, and quality. The evaluations provided by validators influence the rewards distributed to miners and help maintain the overall quality of the subnet's outputs. Validators are also responsible for ensuring that the tasks performed align with the subnet's objectives and that the outputs meet the required standards.​

The mechanism of Subnet 20 operates on a decentralized, incentive-based model. Miners and validators are rewarded based on their contributions to the network, with emissions distributed according to their performance. The subnet employs a competitive environment where miners strive to produce high-quality outputs, and validators ensure that the generated content meets the necessary standards. This system fosters innovation and excellence within the subnet, driving the development of advanced task and workflow management capabilities.​
