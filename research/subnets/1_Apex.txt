Subnet 1: Text Prompting
Description: The inaugural Bittensor subnet dedicated to text generation, termed the Finney Prompt Subnetwork. It supports prompt-based neural networks like GPT-3, GPT-4, and ChatGPT in a decentralized fashion.
Primary Function: Advanced language model capabilities and conversation through a decentralized network of validators and miners
Key Features: 
- Human-like conversation through roleplay and persona simulation
- Support for multiple task types (Q&A, text summarization, code debugging, translation, math)
- Mixture of Experts (MoE) system for specialized task routing
- Advanced challenge generation with corrupted prompts to prevent simple internet lookups
- String literal and semantic similarity scoring

Additional Info: 
- Operates through a validator-miner system where validators generate challenges and miners respond
- Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for both challenge generation and response
- Implements innovative techniques for human-like conversation
- Generates synthetic datasets for fine-tuning other LLMs
- Developing API layer for inter-subnet communication
