Subnet 29: Coldint
Description: Collaborative model training and research
Primary Function: Distributed model training and research
Key Features: Collaborative learning, model training, research tools
Built By: Coldint 


Bittensor Subnet 29, known as Coldint, is a decentralized network focused on advancing collaborative, distributed model training and research. Its mission is to enhance collective training efforts within the Bittensor community by incentivizing the exchange of models, knowledge, insights, and code. Coldint was created in response to the frustration miners experienced with other subnets, aiming to align validation logic with the core focus on training within the subnet. Over the past months, the team has analyzed and improved upon existing validator codebases, leading to the development of a refined version of Subnet 9's validator, which now serves as the foundation for Coldint.

Miners in Coldint are primarily rewarded for their contributions through the creation and public sharing of trained models. They are encouraged to enhance existing models and share their improvements regularly, fostering a collaborative environment. Additionally, miners can earn incentives by contributing to the canonical miner codebase, whether by identifying bugs, adding features and optimizations, or rewriting significant portions of the code. This approach motivates both individual and collective contributions, accelerating the overall progress of the subnet.

Validators in Coldint play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the models shared by miners. They evaluate the performance of the models based on predefined criteria and provide feedback to miners. Validators also assess the contributions to the codebase, rewarding those who enhance the functionality and efficiency of the system. The evaluation process is designed to be transparent and fair, with measures in place to prevent exploitation of known tactics that could misalign miner and subnet objectives. Bug bounties are offered to encourage the reporting of vulnerabilities, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with the subnet's goals.

The mechanism of Coldint operates on a decentralized, incentive-based model. Miners and validators are rewarded with TAO tokens based on their contributions and performance. The subnet employs a continuous improvement cycle, with regular updates to training objectives, validator and miner codebases, and the overall system. This dynamic approach fosters a thriving community that thrives on the exchange of ideas, insights, and knowledge, driving the development of advanced models and applications within the Bittensor ecosystem.
