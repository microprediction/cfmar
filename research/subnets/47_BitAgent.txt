Functionality
In Score Predict, validators distribute upcoming football match data to miners, who then use machine learning models to predict outcomes such as win, loss, or draw. These predictions are submitted back to the validators, who compare them against actual match results to assess accuracy. Miners are rewarded based on the precision of their predictions, encouraging the development of effective predictive models.​
