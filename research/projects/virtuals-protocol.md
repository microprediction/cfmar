# Virtuals Protocol

## Overview
Virtuals Protocol is a decentralized platform launched in 2021 that bills itself as "The Wall Street for AI Agents" â€“ a marketplace where AI agents can be created, bought/sold (tokenized), and co-owned by multiple people. The platform's goal is to lower the barrier for AI enthusiasts to build and monetize agents. Users can collaborate to develop an AI agent, package it as a crypto token, and share in any revenue the agent generates.
