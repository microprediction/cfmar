# Chainlink

## Overview
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable, tamper-proof data feeds for smart contracts. It serves as a crucial "ground truth" mechanism for prediction markets by supplying verifiable, consensus-based data about real-world events and prices. This is essential for resolving prediction market outcomes and ensuring market integrity.

## Key Features
- Decentralized oracle network for ground truth
- Multiple data source aggregation for consensus
- Price feeds for market resolution
- VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for randomness
- Cross-chain compatibility for universal truth

## Technical Architecture
- Decentralized oracle nodes for data verification
- Multiple data source aggregation for consensus
- Consensus mechanisms for truth validation
- Smart contract integration for market resolution
- Cross-chain bridges for universal truth

## Oracle Mechanics
- Data source aggregation for consensus
- Node operator network for verification
- Consensus validation for ground truth
- Data feed updates for market resolution
- Cross-chain data delivery for universal truth

## Token Economics
- LINK token for node operation and truth verification
- Node operator rewards for maintaining ground truth
- Data provider incentives for accurate reporting
- Network security staking for truth assurance
- Cross-chain bridge fees for universal truth

## Current Status
- Widely adopted as ground truth mechanism
- Multiple chains supported for universal truth
- Growing node network for verification
- Expanding data feeds for market resolution
- Improving security for truth assurance

## Relevance to Book
- Critical infrastructure for prediction market resolution
- Shows how to establish reliable ground truth on-chain
