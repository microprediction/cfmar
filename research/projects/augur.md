# Augur

## Overview
Augur is one of the first decentralized prediction markets built on Ethereum. It allows users to create and trade in prediction markets for any event, with outcomes determined by decentralized oracle reporting.

## Key Features
- Decentralized prediction markets
- Ethereum-based smart contracts
- REP (Reputation) token for dispute resolution
- Automated market making
- Decentralized oracle system

## Technical Architecture
- Built on Ethereum
- Uses REP token for reporting
- Automated market maker for liquidity
- Decentralized oracle for outcome resolution
- Smart contract-based market creation

## Market Mechanics
- Users can create markets for any event
- Automated market maker provides liquidity
- REP holders report on outcomes
- Dispute resolution through REP staking
- Fees distributed to REP holders

## Token Economics
- REP token for reporting and dispute resolution
- Market creation fees
- Trading fees
- Reporting rewards
- Dispute resolution incentives

## Current Status
- Active development
- Multiple versions released
- Growing user base
- Expanding market types
- Improving oracle system

## Relevance to Book
- Example of decentralized prediction markets
- Shows how price mechanisms can work in practice
- Demonstrates automated market making
- Illustrates decentralized oracle systems
- Case study in market design
