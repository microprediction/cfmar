# Autonolas (Olas)

## Overview
Autonolas (rebranded as Olas) is a platform and DAO for user-owned autonomous agents running on blockchain. Founded in 2021 by the team at Valory, Olas enables developers and non-experts alike to deploy AI agents that operate independently and even earn income for their owners. The core idea is an "agent economy" where individuals can spin up agents to perform tasks across multiple networks, while retaining full ownership and control.
