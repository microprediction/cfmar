# Fetch.ai

## Overview
Fetch.ai is a Cambridge-based project building an open infrastructure for Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs) â€“ software agents that can make decisions and transact without constant human oversight. Its vision is to create a decentralized "machine-to-machine" economy, combining blockchain and machine learning to enable autonomous services in sectors from logistics to smart cities.
