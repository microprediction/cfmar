Peter Cotton’s Microprediction thesis reframes forecasting not as monolithic algorithmic black-boxes, but as a tapestry of “mini-machines”—lightweight statistical routines that each make a tiny, local prediction. By imbuing these routines with token-based economic agency, each piece of code becomes an autonomous micro-agent: it assesses its own performance, stakes value on its forecasts, and adapts its behavior to maximize rewards. This alignment of statistical rigor and market incentives creates a living ecosystem of forecasters, rather than a single, centralized oracle.

At the heart of this vision is the idea that agents—each a self-contained snippet of predictive logic—can be composed into higher-order supply chains. One agent might specialize in smoothing noisy financial ticks, another in modeling intraday volatility, and yet another in detecting regime shifts; together, they form layers of processing that mirror industrial supply streams. The output of one becomes the input of the next, and economic incentives ensure each link in the chain continuously refines its service for downstream consumers.

Proper scoring rules underpin the economic agency of each micro-machine. By rewarding strictly on calibration and sharpness—via the continuous ranked probability score or the log score—the system guarantees that an agent’s best strategy is honest, uncertainty-aware forecasting. Agents that misrepresent their confidence or “overfit” to apparent short-term patterns pay an economic penalty, pruning poor contributors and reinforcing a meritocratic marketplace of ideas.

As these agent-modules accrue stake and reputation within the network, they become reusable building blocks. Cotton envisions a registry of open-source micro-agents, each tagged by its statistical methodology, domain expertise, and performance history. Data scientists can assemble these into bespoke supply-chain pipelines—much as software engineers compose libraries—to tackle new forecasting tasks without reinventing foundational machinery.

The aggregate behavior of these autonomous components yields a robust ensemble. Unlike conventional model blending—manually weighted or grid-searched—microprediction’s supply-chain structure dynamically routes value to the most reliable agents at each juncture. When market conditions shift or new data patterns emerge, economic pressure naturally reallocates resources, phasing out underperformers and scaling up innovative newcomers.

Architecturally, the network exposes a low-latency API through which micro-agents register their stakes, submit predictions, and retrieve upstream forecasts. This streamlined interface supports rapid iteration: a researcher can deploy a new kernel for intraday trend detection, connect it into an existing supply chain, and observe real-time economic feedback. The result is an agile R&D loop that collapses traditional barriers between experimentation and production.

By decentralizing predictive power into swarms of collaborating agents, Cotton’s thesis also addresses resilience and trust. No single failure or malicious node can sabotage the entire forecast chain, since downstream agents can reroute around underperforming peers. Cryptographic proofs record each prediction and transaction, creating an immutable audit trail that bolsters accountability and deters manipulation.

The open-source ethos extends to the economic supply chains themselves. Just as one might inspect a Git dependency tree, any participant can trace which micro-agents contributed to a final forecast, examine their code, and benchmark their stake- earning efficiency. This transparency fosters an ecosystem where best-in-class agent designs propagate rapidly, and novel approaches—such as deep-kernel mixtures or attention-based intraday filters—can find adopters organically.

In practical terms, these coordinated chains of micro-agents can serve as digital infrastructure across domains. Energy grids could use nested agents to predict load, price, and renewable generation; autonomous vehicles might subscribe to layered forecasts of traffic, weather, and pedestrian patterns; supply chains themselves could forecast demand, lead times, and risk, then automatically allocate inventory based on the ensemble’s probabilistic insights.

Ultimately, the Microprediction thesis posits that by wrapping “small pieces of statistical machinery” with economic agency, and orchestrating them into adaptive supply chains, we unlock a new paradigm of continuous, crowd-sourced intelligence. Prediction stops being the province of isolated giants and becomes a collective, self-optimizing service—where the network’s health, diversity, and adaptability are directly tied to the incentives of its constituent agents.
