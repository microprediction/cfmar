# Subnet 27 (Compute) and the Microprediction Thesis

## Overview
Subnet 27, the Compute subnet, represents a significant advancement in the microprediction thesis by demonstrating how decentralized computing resources can enhance prediction market capabilities and performance.

## Alignment with Microprediction Principles

### 1. Mini-Machines and Economic Agency
- **Decentralized Computing**: The subnet's validator-miner system embodies the microprediction concept of distributed, autonomous agents
- **Economic Incentives**: Validators and miners operate as independent economic agents, staking value on their performance
- **Resource Assessment**: The system includes sophisticated mechanisms for evaluating computing capabilities

### 2. Specialized Supply Chains
- **Compute Protocols**: Implements the thesis's vision of specialized agents working in concert
- **Resource Allocation**: Demonstrates how different agents can specialize in specific computing tasks
- **Performance Assurance**: Shows how multiple agents can verify and validate computing output

### 3. Proper Scoring and Economic Alignment
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Combines efficiency and reliability metrics
- **Compute Challenges**: Uses diverse workloads to ensure robust capabilities
- **Performance-Based Rewards**: Aligns with the thesis's emphasis on proper scoring rules

### 4. Reusable Building Blocks
- **Compute Models**: Creates reusable resource allocation frameworks
- **Performance Metrics**: Produces standardized measures for computing quality
- **Modular Architecture**: Supports the thesis's vision of composable compute components

## Contributions to the Thesis

### 1. Technical Implementation
- Demonstrates practical implementation of decentralized computing
- Shows how compute resources can be integrated into a microprediction framework
- Proves the viability of economic incentives in maintaining compute quality

### 2. Innovation in Computing
