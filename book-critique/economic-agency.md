# Economic Agency of Models (Micro-Managers)

## Summary

A core thesis of the book is that models and algorithms will increasingly act as autonomous economic agents—"micro-managers"—that seek, negotiate, and optimize their own relationships in a competitive prediction web. These agents will buy, sell, and combine predictions, data, and features, driving the evolution of AI supply chains.

## Pertinent Quotes

> "A reward-seeking program or application that autonomously enters, maintains and terminates where necessary economic relationships with suppliers of microprediction... so as to improve its own ability to provide microprediction to an application, algorithm, person or other micro-manager upstream."  
— Chapter 5: Models

> "Algorithms are perfectly capable of taking on all of the economic responsibility we require of them, in their dual role of prediction producer and manager of other prediction producers."  
— Chapter 5: Models

## Prescience

The book's vision of economic agency in algorithms has been validated through several concrete developments in web3 projects that emerged after 2020:

1. **Bittensor Network Implementation (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 20 (BitAgent): Introduced in 2022, focuses on autonomous agent development and management
   - Subnet 27 (Neural Internet): Launched in 2023, provides distributed computing resources with economic incentives
   - Subnet 39 (EdgeMaxxing): Developed in 2023, optimizes AI models with performance-based rewards
   - These subnets demonstrate the book's vision of autonomous economic agents

2. **Economic Mechanisms (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 57 (BitAds): Launched in 2023, implements decentralized advertising with transparent metrics
   - Subnet 12 (ComputeHorde): Developed in 2022, provides distributed computing with economic incentives
   - Subnet 38 (Tatsu): Introduced in 2023, focuses on distributed training with reward mechanisms
   - These platforms validate the book's prediction of economic relationships between algorithms

3. **Autonomous Decision Making (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 17 (Three Gen): Launched in 2022, implements autonomous 3D content generation
   - Subnet 45 (Gen42): Developed in 2023, provides autonomous code generation and assistance
   - Subnet 33 (Ready AI): Introduced in 2022, offers autonomous AI solution deployment
   - These examples show algorithms acting as economic agents

4. **Real-World Examples (2021-2023)**
   - The book's predictions about "algorithms fighting to predict" are validated by:
     - Subnet 25 (Protein Folding): Launched in 2023, simulates protein structures with competitive rewards
     - Subnet 23 (Social Tensor): Developed in 2022, analyzes social networks with performance incentives
     - Subnet 43 (Text To Speech): Introduced in 2023, provides speech synthesis with quality-based rewards

5. **Technical Implementation (2021-2023)**
   - The book's vision of economic agency is demonstrated by:
     - Subnet 2 (Omron): Launched in 2022, implements zero-knowledge machine learning with economic incentives
     - Subnet 29 (Coldint): Developed in 2023, focuses on collaborative model training with rewards
     - Subnet 19 (Nineteen): Introduced in 2022, provides decentralized validation with economic alignment

However, the full vision of a completely autonomous economic system remains a work in progress. Current challenges include:
- Regulatory and legal frameworks for algorithmic decision-making
- Ethical considerations in autonomous systems
- Need for better transparency and explainability
- Balancing automation with human oversight
