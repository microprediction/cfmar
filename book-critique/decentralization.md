# Decentralization of AI and the Prediction Web

## Summary

The book argues that artificial intelligence will not remain a centralized, monolithic discipline. Instead, it will evolve into a decentralized network—a "prediction web"—where predictive power is distributed across many autonomous agents and organizations. This decentralization is expected to drive innovation, lower costs, and democratize access to predictive capabilities.

## Pertinent Quotes

> "As with computing prophesies of yesteryear that only saw enterprise use, I suspect we are mostly blind to what the equivalent of an in-house data science team will eventually be used for, once shrunk down to the size of a thimble."  
— Afterword

> "Microprediction ought to be as useful as electricity, to as many people. Firms can, through trade in microprediction, unlock the enormous latent economic value locked in the now, as it were: the potential for sharing and reuse of data and features."  
— Chapter 4: Economics

## Prescience

The book's vision of decentralized AI has been validated through several concrete developments:

1. **Federated Learning**
   - The book's prediction of distributed model training has materialized through:
     - Google's federated learning for mobile keyboard predictions
     - Apple's privacy-preserving machine learning
     - Healthcare collaborations using federated learning across institutions
   - These examples demonstrate the shift from centralized to distributed model training

2. **Decentralized Data Marketplaces**
   - The book's vision of data sharing and reuse has led to:
     - Ocean Protocol for decentralized data marketplaces
     - IOTA's data marketplace
     - Numerai's decentralized hedge fund
   - These platforms enable secure, decentralized data sharing and prediction

3. **Autonomous Agents**
   - The book's concept of "micro-managers" has been realized through:
     - Algorithmic trading systems
     - Automated ML model deployment
     - Self-optimizing systems in cloud computing
   - These examples show the emergence of autonomous decision-making systems

4. **Real-World Examples**
   - The book specifically mentions:
     - "Algorithms are modeling the residuals of other algorithms"
     - "They are examining the community implied percentiles of each and every recorded data point"
     - "This multi-layer assessment of predictive accuracy is more rigorous and comprehensive than what we find in most in-house data science work"
   - These predictions have been validated by:
     - Ensemble methods in production ML systems
     - Multi-agent systems in robotics
     - Decentralized AI in IoT networks

5. **Economic Impact**
   - The book's prediction about the economic value of decentralization is supported by:
     - The growth of the AI market from centralized to distributed solutions
     - The emergence of new business models based on decentralized AI
     - The increasing importance of edge computing and distributed systems

However, the full vision of a completely decentralized "prediction web" remains a work in progress. Current challenges include:
- Technical barriers to seamless decentralization
- Regulatory and privacy concerns
- Need for better standardization and interoperability
- Economic incentives for participation in decentralized networks
