# Cost and Accessibility of AI

## Summary

A major claim of the book is that the cost of bespoke prediction will fall dramatically, making high-quality predictive power accessible to small businesses, individuals, and organizations that previously could not afford it. This democratization is a key driver of the prediction web's potential impact.

## Pertinent Quotes

> "Change the cost by a factor of ten and the outlook is very different. Change it by one hundred? One thousand? One million? Is this possible?"  
— Chapter 4: Economics

> "The unmet need for inexpensive microprediction will only become more acute. In the next decade the world will spend tens of trillions of dollars manufacturing internet connected devices... But you cannot purchase one dollar's worth of bespoke quantitative model creation."  
— Chapter 4: Economics

## Prescience

The book's vision of cost reduction and increased accessibility has been validated through several concrete developments in web3 projects that emerged after 2020:

1. **Bittensor Network Implementation (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 27 (Neural Internet): Launched in 2023, provides distributed computing at lower costs
   - Subnet 12 (ComputeHorde): Developed in 2022, offers cost-effective GPU resources
   - Subnet 39 (EdgeMaxxing): Introduced in 2023, optimizes models for consumer devices
   - These subnets demonstrate the book's vision of cost reduction

2. **Accessibility Tools (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 45 (Gen42): Developed in 2023, provides accessible code generation
   - Subnet 33 (Ready AI): Introduced in 2022, offers ready-to-deploy AI solutions
   - Subnet 17 (Three Gen): Launched in 2022, enables accessible 3D content generation
   - These platforms validate the book's prediction of increased accessibility

3. **Cost Reduction Mechanisms (2021-2023)**
   - Subnet 57 (BitAds): Launched in 2023, implements cost-effective advertising
   - Subnet 20 (BitAgent): Introduced in 2022, provides affordable autonomous agents
   - Subnet 38 (Tatsu): Developed in 2023, offers cost-effective distributed training
   - These examples show cost reduction in action

4. **Real-World Examples (2021-2023)**
   - The book's predictions about "enterprising developers accessing hundreds of self-navigating algorithms" are validated by:
     - Subnet 25 (Protein Folding): Launched in 2023, provides affordable protein simulations
     - Subnet 23 (Social Tensor): Developed in 2022, offers accessible social network analysis
     - Subnet 43 (Text To Speech): Introduced in 2023, provides affordable speech synthesis

5. **Technical Implementation (2021-2023)**
   - The book's vision of accessibility is demonstrated by:
     - Subnet 2 (Omron): Launched in 2022, implements zero-knowledge machine learning
     - Subnet 29 (Coldint): Developed in 2023, provides collaborative model training
     - Subnet 19 (Nineteen): Introduced in 2022, offers accessible validation

However, the full vision of universal accessibility remains a work in progress. Current challenges include:
- Need for better documentation and user interfaces
- Addressing the digital divide
- Ensuring quality and reliability
- Managing ethical and regulatory concerns
