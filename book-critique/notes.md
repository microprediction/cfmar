# Critique of "Microprediction"

## Main Thesis

The central thesis of the book is that artificial intelligence (AI) will not remain a monolithic, centrally managed discipline. Instead, AI will splinter into low-cost, decentralized supply chains, where models and data are sourced, combined, and wielded by autonomous economic agents—"micro-managers"—competing and collaborating in a prediction web. This vision anticipates a future where the cost of bespoke prediction falls dramatically, and the production and distribution of predictive power becomes as ubiquitous and commoditized as electricity.

## Pertinent Quotes and Their Prescience

### 1. On the Future of AI Supply Chains

> "The task of providing 'economical' statistics (meaning cheap) is solved by encouraging 'economical statistics' (meaning statistical tools endowed with economic agency)."  
— Chapter 4: Economics

**Prescience:** This prediction aligns with the current trend toward automated machine learning (AutoML), API marketplaces, and the increasing use of autonomous agents in data science workflows. The vision of statistical tools acting as economic agents is becoming more plausible with the rise of decentralized AI services and federated learning.

### 2. On the Role of Micro-Managers

> "A reward-seeking program or application that autonomously enters, maintains and terminates where necessary economic relationships with suppliers of microprediction... so as to improve its own ability to provide microprediction to an application, algorithm, person or other micro-manager upstream."
— Chapter 5: Models

**Prescience:** The concept of micro-managers foreshadows the emergence of AI agents that autonomously seek, evaluate, and combine models and data sources. While not yet mainstream, this is a direction being explored in agentic AI and multi-agent systems.

### 3. On the Price Mechanism in AI

> "The marvel of the price mechanism lies in the manner that a global optimization is performed using only local optimization, and local knowledge, and in the fact that only a single quantity (price) constitutes a 'sufficient statistic' for decision."
— Chapter 4: Economics

**Prescience:** The analogy to price mechanisms in economics is increasingly relevant as AI marketplaces and data exchanges emerge. However, the full realization of price-driven optimization in AI supply chains is still in its infancy.
