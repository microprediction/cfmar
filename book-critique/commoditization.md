# Commoditization and Unbundling of Prediction

## Summary

The book argues that prediction will become a commoditized service, unbundled from bespoke, high-cost projects and made available as a utility. Recent developments in the AI ecosystem demonstrate this through various specialized services and marketplaces.

## Key Quotes

> "The task of providing 'economical' statistics (meaning cheap) is solved by encouraging 'economical statistics' (meaning statistical tools endowed with economic agency)."  
— Chapter 4: Economics

> "A developer should be able to create applications that are very light on the quant libraries and iterative work, yet draw enough power elsewhere."  
— Chapter 4: Economics

> "The knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess."
— Chapter 4: Economics

> "A reward-seeking program or application that autonomously enters, maintains and terminates where necessary economic relationships with suppliers of microprediction... so as to improve its own ability to provide microprediction to an application, algorithm, person or other micro-manager upstream."
— Chapter 5: Models
