# Decentralized AI & Prediction Markets Research

This repository contains research and analysis of decentralized AI systems and prediction markets, with a focus on their intersection and potential for creating more accurate, transparent, and accessible prediction mechanisms. I put it together in advance of this [talk](https://cfmar.pstat.ucsb.edu/news/event/646). 

## Project Structure

### Research Overview
- [Projects Summary](projects-summary.md) - relevant to broad vision of this [book](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/5486/MicropredictionBuilding-an-Open-AI-Network)).
- [Book Critique](book-critique/) - including a [scathing review](https://github.com/microprediction/cfmar/blob/main/scathing-review.md).
- [Research Projects](research/projects/) - Detailed profiles of individual projects

### Examples
