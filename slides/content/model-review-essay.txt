he Dilbertian Dilemma of Bank Model Review: An Academic Satire
Introduction

Financial institutions like to imagine that they have tamed risk with elaborate “model review” processes and oversight committees. In theory, every complex quantitative model used by a bank – from credit risk scorecards to exotic trading algorithms – is carefully vetted to prevent disasters. In practice, however, this confidence often proves delusional. As one financial strategist observed, banks “collapse by design, masked behind bureaucratic inertia, regulatory complacency, and the illusion of control”


This essay takes a satirical, yet evidence-based, look at the ineffectiveness of model review in banks. It argues that bureaucratic inertia, groupthink, and misaligned incentives render many model risk management programs toothless, failing to stave off systemic dangers. We invoke the Dilbert Principle – the idea that the least competent are promoted to management – to suggest that roles like Model Risk Officer or Validation Lead are sometimes filled not by bold critics, but by those least likely to challenge “business-as-usual.” Historical examples from the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009, including the antics of credit rating agencies, the failure of Value-at-Risk (VaR) models, and the collapses of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, illustrate these points. The discussion spans the U.S. and beyond, noting that these problems are global in nature. The tone is satirical but informed, aiming to expose the absurdities of bank model governance while grounding the critique in well-documented facts and post-mortems.

The Illusion of Control: Model Review in Theory vs. Practice

In modern banks, model review and validation functions are supposed to serve as a check on quants and traders. Large banks have entire departments dedicated to Model Risk Management (MRM), replete with policies and regulatory guidelines. On paper, this framework is meant to ensure models are sound, assumptions are scrutinized, and risks are “known.” In reality, much of this can amount to an illusion of control – a bureaucratic ritual that creates paper trails more than genuine insight. An internal post-mortem after the 2008 crisis noted that blind faith in poorly specified financial models was a major contributor to the meltdown
wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu
. Banks responded by institutionalizing MRM as a discipline, often under regulatory pressure, to avoid a repeat of such “model risk” failures
wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu
. Yet the very explosion of formal processes may have given management a false sense of security. The complex committee structures, documentation requirements, and annual model reviews can become endless loops of approvals that tick all the right boxes – while real risks quietly fester in the background. Indeed, industry observers have wryly noted that in practice model risk management often degenerates into monotonous compliance tasks. One veteran describes that “on the ground we notice that model risk management is sometimes being narrowed down to a set of monotonous tasks; ticking regulatory boxes, performing repetitive jobs such as reimplementing a model somebody else has created, as well as generating massive amounts of documentation that no human can ever consume”
yields.io
. In other words, the form of oversight is there (the reports, the meetings, the signatures), but the substance – real critical challenge of models’ fitness – is missing. The result is a bureaucratic mirage of safety. Everyone is following the protocol, yet no one is truly questioning the model’s conceptual soundness or the institution’s overarching risk strategy. Model review, instead of being a vigilant sentinel, risks becoming a mere ritual – a high-tech box-checking exercise couched in quant jargon.
Bureaucratic Inertia and Groupthink in Risk Oversight
Large financial institutions are famously prone to bureaucratic inertia. Once a procedure or belief is ingrained, changing it is like turning a supertanker. Prior to the 2008 crisis, many banks and regulators alike clung to the prevailing risk models and credit ratings, even as warning signs grew. With hindsight, analysts note that “everyone, from the top banker to the last employee of government bureaucracies, did not fully understand the huge risks that were piling up in these complex financial structures”
cepr.org
. This collective complacency is the essence of groupthink. It wasn’t that nobody saw the storm clouds; it’s that those who did were ignored, or persuaded themselves that “smart folks elsewhere must have it under control.” Groupthink was evident in how banks trusted credit rating agencies blindly in the lead-up to the Global Financial Crisis. The entire market treated ratings as gospel, enabling massive volumes of toxic subprime mortgage securities to be sold as supposedly safe investments. As later reported, the Big Three agencies – S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch – gave their highest AAA ratings to over $3 trillion in subprime-related debt, including loans to borrowers with bad credit and no documentation
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. This was not a niche phenomenon; many institutional investors were actually required by policy to hold only AAA securities, so the machine kept feeding itself
en.wikipedia.org
. It was a classic case of “if everyone else is okay with it, it must be fine.” Within the agencies, internal reviews succumbed to a toxic mix of groupthink and incentive distortion – with analysts under pressure to deliver rosy ratings for the clients paying them. The result? Hundreds of billions of dollars of those AAA securities were eventually downgraded to junk status, and over half a trillion in losses ensued
en.wikipedia.org
. The rating agencies’ failure to “recognize and warn of the risks” of these new-fangled instruments is now legendary
library.hbs.edu
. Yet, leading up to 2008, virtually no one in the big banks or regulatory bodies effectively challenged the credibility of these models and ratings. The illusion of consensus – that the models had been reviewed and the risks quantified – trumped any solitary voices of dissent. Bureaucratic inertia also meant that risk management practices failed to evolve as markets did. Banks and regulators were slow to adapt to new dangers like complex off-balance sheet structures or severe liquidity risks
cepr.org
. A report by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in early 2008 pointed out that firms’ risk models severely underestimated liquidity and market risk, and that there was “excessive and misplaced reliance” on credit ratings
cepr.org
cepr.org
. The obvious question is: why did internal and supervisory oversight allow these practices to continue? A post-crisis analysis bluntly concluded: “The first [reason] is bureaucratic inertia together with poor judgement… [authorities] were just too slow to adapt their priorities and practice to the new dangers”
cepr.org
. In other words, the governance machinery in banks and agencies alike was stuck in old paradigms – stress testing the last war’s risks, while new bombs ticked quietly under their noses. The culture of inertia meant nobody hit the emergency brakes in time. Senior management and model committees often operated under a confirmation bias: as long as the numbers looked good and fell within established limits, there was no impetus to ask uncomfortable questions that might derail the profit engine. Groupthink can be further reinforced by the very hierarchical structure of banks. Junior analysts or validators who spot problems may hesitate to escalate them, especially if the issues contradict the assurances of star traders or renowned PhD quants. A satirical (but not entirely fictional) scenario might involve a risk analyst thinking, “If the model passed all internal checks and everyone above me seems fine with it, who am I to say the emperor has no clothes?” Those who did challenge the consensus often found themselves sidelined. Tellingly, insiders who warned that the prevailing models were built on sand were sometimes dismissed as cranks “opposed to innovation.” European regulators later noted that critics pointing out unrealistic model assumptions were “frequently…called unscientific and opposed to innovation” during the pre-2008 boom
bundesbank.de
. This perfectly encapsulates the groupthink: instead of reconsidering the models, the system shot the messengers.
Misaligned Incentives: Profit Over Prudence
If bureaucratic culture sets the stage, incentives supply the plot twists in which model reviews fail to avert calamity. In large banks, there is often a fundamental misalignment between what is best for individual actors (traders, executives, even risk managers) and what is best for systemic stability. The Global Financial Crisis exposed how short-term, myopic incentives can neuter risk oversight. Consider the compensation structures on Wall Street before 2008: bonuses were tied to yearly (even quarterly) profits, encouraging extreme risk-taking with other people’s money. If a trader’s complex model generated outsized profits for a few years, they would pocket massive bonuses; if the model blew up in year four, the losses belonged to shareholders (or taxpayers), not the trader. It was “rational,” as one analysis dryly noted, to “under-insure against rare disruptive events, if my bonus only depends on short-term performance”
cepr.org
cepr.org
. In such an environment, model governance becomes perfunctory. There is little appetite to raise alarms about a money-making model – doing so could be a career-limiting move for a risk officer whose management is cheering on the profits. Indeed, a conflict of interest often exists for risk oversight units that report up to the very business lines they are meant to police. The incentives tacitly whisper: “Don’t be the one to spoil the party.” A vivid example was Bear Stearns, the investment bank that imploded in March 2008. Bear’s executives had built a highly leveraged balance sheet stuffed with risky mortgage assets, and they funded it with fickle short-term loans. This was a recipe for disaster – and a basic risk management red flag. Yet it persisted until it was too late. Why? The executive and employee compensation system at Bear Stearns “was based largely on return on equity, creating incentives to use excessive leverage and to focus on short-term gains”
fcic-static.law.stanford.edu
. In other words, the more risk they took, the more money individuals made in the short run. This virtually guaranteed that any internal model reviews would not demand cutting back on leverage or risky assets – doing so would have directly hit the metrics that management was rewarded for. The U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission later concluded bluntly that Bear’s downfall was “a result of weak corporate governance and risk management” in which those incentive distortions played a key role
fcic-static.law.stanford.edu
. The greed for growth outmuscled any cautious voices. A similar story unfolded at many other banks – Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), for instance, embarked on a reckless expansion (culminating in the ill-timed acquisition of ABN AMRO in 2007) that led to its collapse and a £45 billion UK taxpayer bailout. An official review of RBS found a litany of management failures and “errors of judgement and execution” by RBS executives that left the bank catastrophically exposed
fca.org.uk
. Unpacking those errors reveals, again, a pattern of chasing short-term revenue targets and neglecting prudent risk limits. In such climates, model validation teams, even if staffed with brilliant quants, are often implicitly pressured to rubber-stamp models that support the lucrative strategy, rather than challenge them. Another incentive problem lies with the credit rating agencies, as briefly noted earlier. Their business model (issuers pay for ratings) meant they had a financial incentive to please the very clients whose securities they were supposed to objectively assess. During the housing bubble, this led to ratings shopping: investment banks would shop around with their structured mortgage deals to see which agency would give the most favorable rating. A few analysts inside Moody’s and S&P reportedly raised concerns that their models for rating CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations) and mortgage bonds were too optimistic, but these voices had little chance. The agencies’ management knew that if they were too conservative, the Wall Street firms would take their business to a competitor. Thus the incentive structure practically ensured a positive outcome of the “model review” – AAA ratings – regardless of the actual risk. It is darkly comic that, in hindsight, the very institutions entrusted to evaluate risk impartially were arguably paid to be biased. Excessive reliance on these paid-for ratings by banks (who often outsourced their own risk assessment to the ratings) created a dangerous feedback loop where everyone assumed someone else had done the due diligence. When the music stopped, the misplaced incentives of the rating process became painfully clear: virtually all the 2006 vintage subprime mortgage securities rated AAA (the safest rating) were eventually downgraded to junk, an unprecedented collapse of credibility

Case Studies: When Model Reviews Failed Spectacularly
The VaR Debacle – Missing the Forest for the Tails
Perhaps no tool was more emblematic of pre-2008 risk management than Value-at-Risk (VaR) models. VaR was meant to quantify, in a single number, the worst loss a portfolio might suffer in, say, 99% of days. Banks religiously reported their daily VaR and often took comfort that it was “under control.” However, VaR’s focus on normal market conditions and a short historical lookback made it tragically blind to the extreme outlier events that define crises. During 2007–2008, those “1 in 100” worst-case scenarios started happening far more frequently than once every 100 days – and the models couldn’t fathom it. In a moment now famous (and dripping with irony), Goldman Sachs’ Chief Financial Officer remarked in August 2007: “We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation events, several days in a row.”
reuters.com
. Statistically speaking, a 25-sigma event is so implausible it should not occur even once in the lifetime of the universe – let alone day after day. Goldman's CFO (David Viniar) was ridiculed for the statement, as it “raised concerns he didn’t understand fat-tail risks”
reuters.com
. Of course the real point was that Goldman’s highly sophisticated risk models were utterly missing the plot – the model assumed a world of mild fluctuations, while reality was in free fall. The satirical image writes itself: risk managers staring at VaR printouts showing nothing unusual, while behind them the trading floor is on fire. After the dust settled, many banks quietly admitted that their VaR models had been inadequate. Model reviewers and bank executives learned (the hard way) that using a short historical window for VaR “does not generate the extreme outcomes necessary” to estimate true risk exposure
occ.gov
. Essentially, if you feed a calm 2005-2006 dataset into a risk model, don’t be surprised if it doesn’t predict a 2008 cataclysm. It wasn’t that VaR was completely useless – it did measure something – but it was measuring the wrong kind of risk for the situation at hand, and model governance failed to compensate for that blind spot. Rather than supplementing VaR with rigorous stress tests or asking “what if our inputs are wrong?”, too many banks treated VaR as a tick-the-box measure of safety. Some firms even quietly gamed their VaR calculations to reduce capital requirements, a strategy tacitly encouraged by Basel II rules that let banks use internal models to determine risk weights
bundesbank.de
bundesbank.de
. In Europe, internal model-based capital rules gave banks substantial freedom, which “made internal risk models prone to abuse” – and critics of those models were often ignored until it was too late
bundesbank.de
bundesbank.de
. The collective failure of VaR and similar models during the crisis became a humbling lesson: if model review is just a technical checklist that fails to question core assumptions, “garbage in, garbage out” will prevail. A risk model can have 1,000 inputs and state-of-the-art complexity, and still be catastrophically wrong if everyone assumes it must be right.
The Gaussian Copula: “The Formula That Killed Wall Street”
No discussion of model folly is complete without the Gaussian copula – a formula introduced by statistician David X. Li that became ubiquitous in pricing CDOs and other structured credit products in the 2000s. This elegant mathematical model allowed quants to couple together the default probabilities of hundreds of bonds into one neat risk distribution. Bankers loved it because it seemingly quantified the unquantifiable: the correlation of mortgage defaults. Armed with Li’s model, firms believed they could slice and dice mortgages into tranches with precise risk levels, many of which obtained AAA ratings. For a while, it was alchemy – high returns and low risk, according to the models. Internal model reviewers generally blessed the Gaussian copula approach; after all, it was published in academic journals and implemented by PhDs. Few questioned its underlying assumption (a multivariate normal distribution linking defaults) or noticed how dangerously sensitive the model was to small errors in inputs. The “copula” became a cornerstone of the structured finance boom. In hindsight, the blind faith in this model was disastrously naive. By 2009, when these structures had blown up, the Gaussian copula was being cursed as “the formula that killed Wall Street”
wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu
. A Wired magazine article by that title laid out how reliance on Li’s formula lulled the industry into a false sense of security
wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu
. What went wrong? In simple terms, the model drastically underestimated the likelihood of simultaneous defaults – it assumed correlations that held in good times would remain benign in bad times. Firms using the copula model were effectively flying blind: the risk measures said everything was fine, until suddenly everything collapsed at once. Here again, model governance and review failed on a conceptual level. Validation teams often focus on back-testing models against recent data (which the copula passed with flying colors, using pre-2006 housing data), or checking the math (which was technically correct). But they gave less scrutiny to “what if the core distributional assumption is wrong?”. With hindsight, that was the only question that mattered. Instead, come 2007–2008, the high-rated CDO tranches correlated in failure close to 1.0 – they all sank together, obliterating the supposedly robust risk-diversification that the Gaussian copula had promised. This episode underscores that opaque internal models, blessed by perfunctory reviews, can become ticking time bombs. As one Wharton study noted, the crisis taught us the danger of having “model on, brain off” – using complex models without a healthy dose of skepticism and robust checks

Lehman Brothers: When Risk Management Was “Overruled”
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 remains the canonical example of a systemic failure. While multiple factors led to Lehman’s demise, a crucial one was the breakdown of internal risk governance – arguably a case of the Dilbert Principle in action. Lehman did have a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and risk committee, but evidence shows that by the height of the mortgage bubble, they were toothless relative to top management’s hubris. Madelyn Antoncic, Lehman’s CRO from 2002 to late 2007, later recounted how the firm’s leadership increasingly brushed aside risk concerns. In her words, Lehman’s top brass developed an attitude of “We’re making a lot of money, so let’s take more risk”, and they gradually sidelined the risk management function
knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu
. By early 2007, as the housing market cracked, Antoncic “was just sidelined,” and a court-appointed examiner’s report later found that “risk management was repeatedly overruled” by Lehman’s executives
knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu
. In a darkly comic maneuver, Lehman effectively removed or ignored the very people tasked with checking its models and exposures, at the exact moment when rigorous oversight was most needed. This aligns too well with the Dilbert Principle: the more a risk officer tried to do their job (and thus threatened to impede aggressive growth), the less welcome they became in the decision-making circle. Lehman replaced Antoncic as CRO in 2007 with a new risk chief who, presumably, would be more compliant to the CEO’s wishes. It is as if Lehman promoted the “least threatening” candidate to oversee risk – someone who wouldn’t make a fuss about the escalating bets on subprime mortgages. The result was predictable. Lehman’s risk models and limits, even if formally in place, had no real power. Management ignored internal warnings, and the balance sheet swelled with toxic assets. When the crisis hit, the firm’s thin capital and liquidity evaporated. Former CRO Antoncic bluntly traced Lehman’s collapse to management’s “brushing aside of risk management principles” – a fatal error born of arrogance
knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu
. Lehman’s story is a cautionary tale of what happens when model review becomes a charade: the risk officers had models showing potential losses, but their voices carried no weight against a bullish leadership narrative.
The Global (and Ongoing) Nature of the Problem
While U.S. investment banks often take center stage, it’s important to note that European and other international banks were not immune to these dynamics – far from it. In Europe, many banks eagerly adopted the Basel II framework in the mid-2000s, which allowed them to use internal models to calculate regulatory capital. The idea was to tailor capital to actual risk, but in practice it often meant banks could tweak models to minimize capital holds. A German banker famously quipped that if you give 10 banks the same portfolio to risk-weight, you’d get 10 different answers – each one lowest in that bank’s preferred areas. European banks accumulated massive exposures to U.S. subprime assets as well. UBS, for example, had to write down over $50 billion on CDOs and received a bailout from the Swiss central bank. Many smaller European institutions (like German Landesbanken and the Irish banks) were caught holding AAA-rated U.S. mortgage securities that imploded. They, too, had risk committees that ostensibly reviewed these investments; yet they, too, fell prey to the trust in ratings and models. The royal catastrophe of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) highlights how international this problem was. RBS, once one of the largest banks in the world, collapsed in 2008 and required the largest banking rescue in UK history. A U.K. investigation found that RBS’s failure was due to multiple poor decisions by management – essentially a “level of incompetence” in strategic judgment – combined with an overall deficient risk management framework
fca.org.uk
. Importantly, it wasn’t just bad luck or U.S. subprime that sank RBS; it was how RBS was run and how its risks weren’t adequately questioned or curtailed. In effect, the same patterns of over-optimistic models, meek oversight, and incentive to chase growth played out across the Atlantic. Fast forward to more recent times, and echoes of these issues still reverberate globally. In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the U.S. suddenly failed after making outsized bets on long-duration bonds without proper hedging. Astonishingly, SVB had no Chief Risk Officer for 8 months leading up to its collapse, and it grossly mismanaged interest rate risk on its balance sheet
ecmi.eu
. One commentator dryly noted that SVB’s fate “raises serious concerns about the ability of regulators to spot risks ahead of time,” given that basic risk management practices were neglected
ecmi.eu
ecmi.eu
. In Europe, the long-ailing Credit Suisse finally unraveled in 2023, after years of scandals and risk management lapses (from rogue trading losses to exposure to imploded funds like Archegos). Despite beefed-up post-2008 regulations, these cases show that simply having layers of model review and risk officers is not enough if fundamental cultural problems persist. Whether it’s a regional bank or a global giant, the story is similar: internal controls existed on paper, but in the crunch they functioned as stage props rather than actual brakes.
The Dilbert Principle in the Banking World
The Dilbert Principle – coined by cartoonist Scott Adams – posits that organizations systematically promote their least competent employees into management, to limit the damage they can do in real productive work
en.wikipedia.org
. While intended as satire, it contains an uncomfortable grain of truth for banks’ risk governance. If one looks at certain banks pre-2008 (and perhaps even now), it does feel as if the people in charge of overseeing complex models were often those least likely to question them. In a Dilbert-esque corporation, the head of model validation might be someone who isn’t a troublemaker or visionary, but rather a bureaucrat content to follow procedures. After all, a highly competent quantitative expert with a deep understanding of risk might be too challenging – they might raise red flags that disrupt profitable business lines. From the perspective of short-sighted executives, it could seem preferable to have a pliant, non-confrontational person in that role, someone who will “order the doughnuts and yell at people for not doing their assignments – you know, the easy work” as Adams joked
en.wikipedia.org
. The satirical sting is that such a person, lacking genuine insight or courage, will rubber-stamp models and go through the motions, inadvertently encouraging a status quo bias. One can argue that this is exactly what happened in cases like Lehman Brothers – the effective CRO by 2007 was not someone inclined or empowered to slam the brakes. In some banks, risk management roles became a stopping ground for those executives whom the bank didn’t know what else to do with. They had a title and an office, but no real clout – a classic Dilbertian setup where “incompetent employees are promoted to management to minimize their ability to harm productivity”
en.wikipedia.org
. The productivity in this context was the bank’s aggressive risk-taking and profit-chasing; a too-competent, too-assertive risk manager would indeed “harm” that by insisting on caution. Thus, by the Dilbert Principle logic, the less a risk officer knows or objects, the more secure their position. It’s a cynical view, but numerous insiders and post-mortems hint at it. There is also a feedback loop at play: because model risk management developed a reputation as a backwater (a cost center, not a profit center), top talent often avoided it. Talented quants preferred to be on the frontlines building models (where the excitement and money were), rather than in validation teams poring over documentation
yields.io
. As a result, model review departments struggled to attract and retain the best people
yields.io
. This talent gap can reinforce the Dilbert Principle dynamic – if a function is seen as low-prestige and if its influence is systematically undercut, it may indeed end up staffed by less experienced or less dynamic individuals over time. Those who remain might either be true believers struggling against the tide, or, as Dilbert would have it, paper-pushing managers content with bureaucracy. Of course, this is not universally true of all banks or all risk managers – many are highly competent and do push back (and some banks avoided the worst precisely because of strong risk governance cultures). But the satire highlights a real pattern: banks that sailed blindly into the storm often had weak-willed or sidelined people in roles that should have been sounding the alarm. When the inmates are running the asylum – or the traders are running the bank without effective oversight – it’s only a matter of time before trouble hits.
Box-Ticking Compliance vs. Meaningful Oversight
If there is one phrase that captures the failure of model review, it is “box-ticking.” Time and again, investigations after crises find that banks were technically compliant with rules and procedures – yet fundamentally unsafe. Model review becomes a checkbox exercise when reviewers focus on superficial metrics (Does the model documentation have all required sections? Did we formally sign off on the annual review?) rather than substantive questions (Is the model based on reality? What could make it catastrophically wrong? Are we prepared for that?). A poignant example is how stress testing was initially implemented. After 2008, regulators introduced regular stress tests expecting banks to imagine worst-case scenarios. Banks did run those tests – but often the scenarios were mild or had loopholes, and banks optimized to pass the test rather than truly probe their vulnerabilities. This is compliance mentality: doing the minimum to get regulators off one’s back, instead of using the tools to genuinely manage risk. Within model validation teams, the procedural workload can become overwhelming: countless models to review, each with thick documentation and technical appendices. The pressure to clear models (so business can proceed) means validations are often rushed or templated. A satirical yet common scene: a validator spends weeks replicating a front-office model in MATLAB or Python (to ensure it “computes correctly”), writes a 50-page report, lists a few minor findings (e.g., “assumption X should be justified with more historical data”), and then issues an approval. Everyone checks the box and moves on. What got lost is asking whether assumption X is actually reasonable or whether historical data is even a guide for this product in stress conditions. The focus skews to process over judgment. Massive documents are produced – so many that “no human can ever consume [them] in their entirety”
yields.io
 – but the core insight (“this model will break if housing prices fall 30%”) might be buried or not even articulated. As one risk expert lamented, prior to the crisis, banks’ risk reports and VAR numbers created an illusion of control that led decision-makers to become complacent
linkedin.com
. The box-ticking made everyone feel something was being done, even if in reality, the most critical questions remained unasked. Regulators have recognized this problem to some extent. For example, the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in recent years has explicitly told banks that model risk management must not be a tick-box exercise, but rather a substantive discipline. Guidance and principles are issued emphasizing senior accountability, challenge culture, and limits on model complexity. But regulation can only go so far if the underlying institutional mindset doesn’t change. As long as big banks operate in silos, with risk teams divorced from strategic power and business teams viewing compliance as a hurdle, the danger is that model review will continue to be more of a performance than a safeguard. The situation is akin to the “maginot line” of banking – formidable on paper, but too rigid and easily bypassed in practice. For example, banks boasted of VAR limits and triple-A tranche holdings (all seemingly safe), while the real threats – liquidity freezes, correlated market collapses – marched around those defenses. A complacent belief that “we have complied with all regulations, so we must be safe” can set in, which is exactly the opposite of true risk management. Meaningful oversight would require dynamic thinking: contrarian views, scenario analyses that go beyond historical norms, empowerment of risk teams to veto products, and simpler, more transparent risk metrics that top executives can actually understand and act on. Instead, what we often got was mathematical theater – highly quantitative reports that gave senior management an excuse to nod and move on, without truly grasping the fragility building up.
Conclusion
In the final analysis, the ineffectiveness of model review in banks is a product of organizational choices and culture. We have painted a satirical picture, invoking Dilbertian logic, but the satire is uncomfortably close to reality. Major banks in the 2000s (and some even after) often let bureaucracy, groupthink, and perverse incentives undermine the very safeguards that were supposed to protect them. Model risk management became in many cases a check-the-box formality – a way to claim “risk is under control” without actually curbing the excesses. The Global Financial Crisis provided a harsh lesson in what happens when everyone believes the models and no one asks hard questions. Opaque models blessed by timid reviewers led to real and catastrophic losses. From the AAA-rated subprime CDO that turned to junk, to the VaR numbers that proved meaningless under stress, to the risk officer who was ignored or removed for raising concerns – the patterns are clear. Banks that survived or fared better were typically those that did have contrarian risk managers or a culture that valued prudence over the last dollar of profit. Globally, regulators and banks have since tried to tighten the process – requiring more rigorous validation and oversight. Yet, as recent events like the SVB and Credit Suisse episodes suggest, we are not immune to repeating history. Even the best models fail if we fall into bureaucratic complacency or let “business-as-usual” priorities erode independent oversight. As one LinkedIn commentator in 2025 remarked, financial institutions don’t implode out of nowhere; they fail when internal inertia and misplaced confidence let risks run ahead of oversight
linkedin.com
. The Dilbert Principle serves as a cheeky reminder that who gets appointed to critical roles matters – a yes-man with a fancy title is no substitute for a competent guardian of risk. Ultimately, meaningful model review requires a healthy dose of skepticism, transparency, and courage. It means rewarding those who raise inconvenient truths, simplifying models so they can be understood (or at least stress-tested for worst cases), and aligning incentives so that preventing a future blow-up is valued at least as much as short-term gains. If not, model review will remain a kind of tragicomic theater – plenty of documents and meetings signifying little, until the next crisis reveals the naked truth. In the spirit of satire, one might say banks need fewer box-tickers and more boat-rockers in risk management. The stakes – as history has shown – are no less than the stability of the global financial system.
